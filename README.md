## Q&A

### __Whenwhenwhen?__  
  Never. But we'll have it working soon! I believe in a basic working server until end of december.

### __Are you still working on this?__  
  As hard as we can.

### __What is currently working?__  
  Login, models should be finished

### __How do I install this?__  
  As of there's currently nothing to have fun with why would you like to install this?
  ```bash
  npm install -g bower
  npm install
  bower install
  ```

### __Why are you rewriting all this from scratch? it was working!__  
  Because it was crap. We mixed PHP with NodeJS and that felt crappy from the first day on.
  I now have time to focus more on the Development of this again, but it's a huge project.
  If you want to help, mail me! Any help is appreciated.

### __So, what are you going to do different?__  
  [Have a list](https://github.com/TeamSynergy/SynergyTube-deprec/issues/154) about what we want
  to do different this time.

### __How can i help/contribute otherwise?__  
  Well, we could need a logo. If you don't know much about backends,
  but about frontends you may have some fun developing a interface?

### __Where do i get answers to my other questions?__
