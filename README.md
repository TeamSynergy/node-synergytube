## Q&A

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Whenwhenwhen?
Never. But we'll have it working soon! I believe in a basic working server until end of december.

### Are you still working on this?
As hard as we can.

### What is currently working?
Login, models should be finished

### How do I install this?
In order to use this you need some prerequisites:
* [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) obviously.
* [bower](http://bower.io/) for package managment: `npm install -g bower`.

* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for building, minifying etc.
* [Redis](http://redis.io/) (optional, only for session caching).
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) (you can also use a MongoDB-as-a-Service-Provider like [mongolab](https://mongolab.com/)).
* A [facebook application](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) for login.
* An [avatars.io](https://avatars.io) for avatars obviously.

Commands:
```bash
npm install
bower install

# Currently not working:
grunt
```

In the future there will be already built releases, but currently you won't come arround this.

Because it was crap. We mixed PHP with NodeJS and that felt crappy from the first day on.
I now have time to focus more on the Development of this again, but it's a huge project.
If you want to help, mail me! Any help is appreciated.

### So, what are you going to do different?
[Have a list](https://github.com/TeamSynergy/SynergyTube-deprec/issues/154) about what we want
to do different this time.

### How can i help/contribute otherwise?
Well, we could need a logo. If you don't know much about backends,
but about frontends you may have some fun developing a interface?

### Where do i get answers to my other questions?
